Work Experience
---------------

*   **Destination Canada** (Vancouver, BC)

    *Data Scientist*, January 2015 - 

<<<<<<< HEAD
    I lead efforts at Destination Canada to use new data sources to understand location and behaviour choices of international visitors to Canada.
    Currently, I work in partnership with Statistics Canada on developing a national tourism spending model using financial transaction data. I am also the project lead for efforts to use mobile phone signal data to understand tourism spatial patterns. 
    Previously, I was the research lead for updating the Explorer Quotient program which is Canada's national tourism segmentation system that is used throughout the industry. In this capacity, I worked on modernizing the segmentation methodology and on developing a strategic roadmap for future evolution of this segmentation system. 
    In addition to major projects, my responsibilities also included building forecast and leading indicator models, statistical analyses, data visualization, dashboards, and modernizing the research team's data management and data science practices.
